## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### See "Failed to fetch data"?
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz

# Should return: {"ok": true}
```

### See "No invoices found"?
- Normal if database is empty
- Try running the IMAP fetch to get data
- Or add test data to database

### Export not working?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend endpoint with curl:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/scraped-data/export/csv
```
